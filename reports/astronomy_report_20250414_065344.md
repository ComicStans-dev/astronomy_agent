# Observation Plan: 2025-04-15

## 1. Overall Conditions Assessment

Conditions tonight are rated as **Average**.  While the weather forecast predicts clear skies (0% cloud cover) and good seeing, the Bortle 8 sky and significant light dome in the south will present challenges.  The moon is below the horizon at the start of astronomical twilight, which is positive. The equipment (Apertura 75Q refractor and ZWO ASI585MC Pro) is suitable for the targets, but light pollution will necessitate careful target selection and potentially the use of a narrowband filter.


## 2. Top Recommended Targets

| Target          | Observability                | Framing Analysis      | Filter Choice & Justification                                                                 | Imaging Tips                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **M51 (Whirlpool Galaxy)** | Peak Alt: 88.43 deg, Duration: 6.92 hr | Good Fit              | No Filter. M51 is a bright galaxy, high in the sky and away from the light dome.  While Bortle 8 presents challenges, its brightness should be sufficient for RGB imaging.  | **Beginner:** Focus carefully to obtain sharp details.  **Advanced:** Use dithering between exposures to reduce noise and enhance image processing. |
| **M101 (Pinwheel Galaxy)** | Peak Alt: 81.29 deg, Duration: 6.92 hr | Widefield             | No Filter. Similar to M51, it's a bright galaxy at a high altitude, minimizing light pollution impact. | **Beginner:**  Use shorter exposures initially to check focus and framing.  **Advanced:** Explore different image processing techniques (e.g., wavelet sharpening) to extract fine details in the spiral arms. |
| **M13 (Hercules Globular Cluster)** | Peak Alt: 80.88 deg, Duration: 5.83 hr | Good Fit              | No Filter.  A bright globular cluster high in the sky. The high altitude minimizes light pollution effects.                    | **Beginner:** Capture sufficient exposures to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio. **Advanced:**  Carefully process the image to resolve individual stars within the cluster core.          |
| **M81 (Bode's Galaxy)** | Peak Alt: 66.52 deg, Duration: 6.92 hr | Good Fit | No Filter. Although at a lower altitude, it's still relatively high, and its brightness should offset the Bortle 8 conditions to some degree.     | **Beginner:** Pay close attention to polar alignment for long exposures. **Advanced:** Use advanced stacking techniques to minimize noise and bring out faint details within the galaxy. |
| **NGC 7000 (North America Nebula)** | Peak Alt: 48.63 deg, Duration: 2.0 hr | Widefield | Dual Narrowband Filter. This is a lower altitude target in the direction of the light dome, requiring the narrowband filter to cut through the light pollution.  | **Beginner:**  Use bias, dark, and flat frames for proper calibration. **Advanced:** Consider narrowband RGB combination techniques for enhanced color representation, focusing on the Ha and OIII emissions.     |


**Note:**  The shorter duration of NGC 7000 is due to its lower altitude and the time it spends above 30 degrees.  Prioritizing high-altitude targets is crucial given the light pollution.  Consider shorter exposures for NGC 7000 to counteract the light pollution.
