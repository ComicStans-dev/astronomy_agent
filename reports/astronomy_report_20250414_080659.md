# Observation Plan: 2025-04-15

## 1. Overall Conditions Assessment

Conditions tonight are rated as **Average**.  The 46% cloud cover presents a moderate challenge, and the average seeing is not ideal. The Bortle 8 sky and significant light dome, particularly in the south, will impact image quality, especially without a narrowband filter.  The absence of moonlight is beneficial.

## 2. Top Recommended Targets

Based on the available equipment, sky conditions, and the pre-calculated data, the following targets are recommended:


| Target           | Observability                 | Framing Analysis       | Filter Choice & Justification                                                                                                   | Imaging Tips                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **M51 (Whirlpool Galaxy)** | Max Alt: 88.43 deg, Duration: 6.92 hr | Good Fit                | No Filter. M51 is a bright galaxy, high in the sky, minimizing light pollution impact. The large FOV allows for capturing the galaxy and its companion.  | **Beginner:** Focus carefully on achieving sharp stars. **Advanced:** Explore different processing techniques to reveal faint details within the galaxy's spiral arms, given the Bortle 8 conditions. |
| **M101 (Pinwheel Galaxy)** | Max Alt: 81.29 deg, Duration: 6.92 hr | Widefield              | No Filter. Similar to M51, its high altitude minimizes light pollution effects. The wide field of view allows for capturing the full extent of this large galaxy. | **Beginner:** Use a short exposure time to avoid saturation in the brighter core.  **Advanced:** Consider using dithering to reduce noise in the final image.  |
| **M13 (Hercules Globular Cluster)** | Max Alt: 80.88 deg, Duration: 5.83 hr | Good Fit                | No Filter.  While a globular cluster, M13's brightness allows for reasonable imaging even in Bortle 8. High altitude helps mitigate light pollution. | **Beginner:** Ensure proper focus to resolve individual stars within the cluster. **Advanced:** Explore different star reduction techniques to bring out the fainter outer stars.   |
| **NGC 7000 (North America Nebula)** | Max Alt: 48.63 deg, Duration: 2.0 hr | Wide field             | Dual Narrowband Filter.  Given its lower altitude and the southern light dome, the dual narrowband filter is crucial to cut through light pollution and isolate the emission nebula's Ha and OIII signals. | **Beginner:**  Use longer exposures than you might for galaxies to capture the faint details. **Advanced:**  Calibration frames (darks, flats, bias) are extremely important to deal with the higher noise inherent in long exposures. |


**Note:** M81 is omitted due to its lower altitude and proximity to the light dome, making it less favorable compared to the selected targets, even with a narrowband filter.  The limited duration of NGC 7000 should be considered for planning imaging time. Prioritizing targets with longer duration and higher altitudes during the most clear part of the night is also recommended.
